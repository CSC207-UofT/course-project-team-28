The specificity in place and community on display in “Harlem” is a major asset that sidesteps a common issue with a lot of new series that take more of a rainbow coalition type-approach to diverse representation. (You know, the box-of-crayons style deal where you only get one of each.) But this approach does not actually lend itself well to culturally specific discussions and storylines, considering relationships or even just dialogue ultimately requires at least two participants. You inevitably end up with a lot of conversations where a character gets stuck explaining their perspectives to an outsider, a setup that does not naturally make for especially good comedy or drama, especially when repeated ad nauseum.
