The central foursome here are Camille (Meagan Good), an adjunct anthropology professor at Columbia University; Tye (Jerrie Johnson) a rising star in the tech world, founder and CEO of Q, a dating app exclusively for queer people of color; Quinn (Grace Byers), a boutique owner and fashion designer still dependent on her wealthy parents to stay afloat; and Angie (Shoniqua Shandai), a talented but chronically unemployed singer and actress living rent-free on Quinn’s couch. Harlem is a main character as much as the central quartet. It might be the most glamorous possible view of Harlem, but it does feel refreshingly and authentically specific to Harlem nonetheless—like it was made by people who know it well, or at least took the time and effort to consult with others who do. Yes, there are other pleasant outliers out there like the EPIX series “Godfather of Harlem,” but these are still more the exception than the general rule. For instance, a film like “Passing,” for all its strengths, makes Harlem feel like the Upper Upper West Side.
