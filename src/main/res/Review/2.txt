Centering four stylish and ambitious thirty-something best friends, the new Amazon series â€œHarlemâ€? feels like one of several recent and upcoming releases that seem to be aiming to fill a â€œSex and the Cityâ€? type void, from â€œThe Sex Lives of College Girlsâ€? to the actual â€œSex and the Cityâ€? revival â€œAnd Just Like That.â€? And considering the overwhelming whiteness of the most prominent titles within the wider â€œNew York City glamourâ€? genre, the all-Black cast and uptown focus of "Harlem" delivers a fresh take on a familiar formula. You know, the one where a group of â€œrelatableâ€? friends in New York City work low-paying jobs, but who also somehow have bottomless closets of impeccably styled designer clothes and live in the most mind-bogglingly gorgeous apartments you have ever seen. Do you have to leave reality at the door for this one? Yes. Is the eye candy worth it? Also yes. This is not a show with repeat outfits, and one characterâ€™s apartment has stained-glass sliding doors that expanded my understanding of just how fabulous sliding doors could be.
