## Project Accessibility Report

**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:**

**(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or**

**(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**

1 Equitable Use

Our program intends to treat every user equally, but may sometimes violate the Equitable Use Principle due to technical limitations. For example, the program does not have text-to-speech and alternative-input-source features for the users with visual impairments. We will implement these features in the future to better serve the users of our program.

2 Flexibility in Use

- 2a. Provide choice in methods of use.
  Our program gives many choices to the user. For example, the user can choose to register as Normal User or Admin User(If they know the admin code).

- 2b. Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.
  Our program has no features related to human’s right- or left-handed, since our program is just an app that allows users to search their favourite movie and leave comments for their movie.

- 2c. Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
  Our app windows are big enough for people to see and each feature has a corresponding button to use. For example, when a user sees the “Edit” button on their profile page, they would know that this is the place for them to change their profile.

- 2d. Provide adaptability to the user's pace.
  Our program’s features are very simple, we do not have any feature that will happen quickly or continuously, like video or music.  All the actions of the app can be controlled by the user.



3 Simple and Intuitive Use
- 3a) Eliminate unnecessary complexity:
  Our program uses icons instead of text to demonstrate some simple function such as coin. There are rarely cases where a user needs to write or type commands like in UI, in GUI, we have implemented buttons for user actions, which is simple and clear to use.

- 3b) Be consistent with user expectations and intuitions:
  As mentioned above, the buttons we implemented in GUI help to better follow this principle. For example, we have four buttons on the welcome page, which allow users to login or register as normal or admin users. The relative text shown on the button matches the user’s expectation. Other buttons also have this function, like Edit or Exit.

- 3c) Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills:
  Although our GUI uses as little as possible texts and uses icons to represent functionalities, the program is a single-language, movie review platform, and our users must have a certain level of language and literacy skills to watch a movie, read reviews and write reviews in English. Therefore this principle does not apply to our program.

- 3d) Arrange information consistent with its importance:
  Our program follows this principle. For example, the user name has the largest font (based on our design decision), and other relevant but less important messages like contact information or user description have smaller fonts.

- 3e) Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion:
  When a user registers, a message box will pop up if the user has successfully registered, or prints a message stating the user has entered invalid username or password. There is also a message showing what symbols are allowed as username and password. This also applies to the login function. For the edit function, if the user clicks “save”, the main page will automatically update the new information and demonstrate it to the user, which is an effective feedback after task completion.


4 Perceptible Information

We use GUI to communicate necessary information effectively to users. In the main page, we use different colors for the button and background, to provide adequate contrast between our essential “buttons” and its surroundings. Moreover, we also add pictures for our users and movies, which are exactly different modes for redundant presentation for our important information. In order to maximize “legibility” of essential information, we also adjust the font of our text and bold some important texts. To make it easy to give instructions, we also number the different reviews.


5 Tolerance for Error

Our design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. Usually, the users follow the instructions that we developers give, but even if when they do not, the code already has a proper way to handled the possible hazards and errors. For example, when they search something that is not in the database or they type some strings that the code can not identify, GUI will tell them this object does not exist and ask them to try again instead of just breaking down and running into some errors which follows the fail safe feature. Also, we print a prompt that is easy to follow with each step, so it does not require much vigilance.


6 Low Physical Effort

We designed a GUI that is easy to use. We have large buttons with clear texts on them, also contrasting color with background,  to make sure they are easy to see and recognize by users. Our GUI is also well-organized with fonts large enough for users to see from a neutral body position. Furthermore, we have picked the best positions on screen for our texts and buttons so that the users can access them while remaining in a neutral body position. For the background image. We used pictures with light and comfortable colors to make sure they won’t hurt the user's eyes. Our program is really simple to use and no duplicated steps needed, which minimize the effort an user needs to use the program. Whichever functionaries that our program acquires, no matter it is register, login, update profile, giving coins or watching movies, they all can be done by one or two simple clicks. The only effort that users need to pay is thinking while writing a review! A thoroughly thought, well-organized review is always appreciated in our program.


7 Size and Space for Approach and Use

The GUI platform is suitable to be used by users with different body sizes, and it also provides a clear line of sight for any seated or standing user. In addition, the design of the GUI platform uses high contrast colours, thus it makes users comfortable receiving information from different viewing angles. Thus, it meets the Principle of Size and Space for Approach and Use.


### 2.
**Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

For our program, the main targeting users would be those who not only like watching movies, but also loves to think and loves to share their thoughts. Our users range across age groups, they can be children, teenagers, adults or even older people, as long as they like movies. We provide a platform for people to share their thoughts about movies freely. Also, we have a coin system which encourages people to write better reviews with deep and thorough thoughts. This is also a function that we have to attract and keep our users, because people enjoy the feeling of their thoughts being recognized and appreciated. Also, the coin system is important because it is the part of our program that enables users to interact with each other. However, these functions only work when the users are people who like movies and are willing to discuss the movies they like. These are the basics that hold our program. Though our targeting users does not restrict age, we do hope that our users have critical thinking ability, so adults would be the best choice (not saying we do not accept users other than adults). This is due to the fact that we want our reviews to have more quality contents over quantity. As the reviews are cumulative, there would be a great quantity eventually, but the reviews with good writing style and thoughts is what we rely on to keep more users.


### 3.
**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.**

Our program is less likely to be used by people who do not watch movies.
