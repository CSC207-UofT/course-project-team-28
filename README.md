## Notes when running our program

Note:


1.If you want to see text-form UI, please run UserInterface class; If you want to see the GUI, please run the GUIMain in GUIMain folder, which is at the bottom of the java folder.

2. due to the codes that we used in some write file classes to get the path of some folders for our program, please open our project from the folder that is outside of the src folder.
For example, you should have a directory that looks like --- [The name of Your own folder] -> src -> main -> …. Here, [The name of Your own folder] is a folder that is one level higher than src, please set this folder as the module and open the project from this folder. Otherwise, our program will have bugs. Thanks you!

3. We have some “fake” movies that we created in the Moviedata folder. When you want to “Search” a movie, you can open the folder of Moviedata to see what kinds of movies we have. The name of txt files under the Moviedata folder is the name of the "fake" movies.

4. The admin code is 123456
