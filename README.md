## Notes Before running the program

Note:



1. due to the codes that we used in some write file classes to get the path of some folders for our program, please open our project from the folder that is outside of the src folder.
For example, you should have a directory that looks like --- [The name of Your own folder] -> src -> main -> …. Here, [The name of Your own folder] is a folder that is one level higher than src, please set this folder as the module and open the project from this folder. Otherwise, our program will have bugs. Thanks you!

2. Our main method is in java --> Framework --> GUI --> GUIChooseLanguage, please run this class in order to run our program.

3. We have some “fake” movies that we created in the Moviedata folder. When you want to “Search” a movie, you can open the folder of Moviedata to see what kinds of movies we have. The name of txt files under the Moviedata folder is the name of the "fake" movies.

4. The admin code is 123456 

5. For the user profile photo and movie picture, please use the defalut pitures that we have provided, please do not drag any new photos into our picture folder, Bugs will occur. 

6. Please do not look at the crc cards, since phase 2 did not require updating it.

7. If you want to look at the UML diagram of our code, we have a pdf version in design document and a .uml diagram in the front page of our github

8. If you want to see the movie with many reviews, please search "Apple"

9. Design document is in phase 2 folder
